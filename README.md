## Music Mapper

APIs used:
1. Spotify API
2. Musixmatch API

Graph Libraries used:
1. D3

Notes:
* Each API call from Spotify API only gives us 20 items (ie. Albums, Songs, Artist, Tracks)
* Each API call from Musixmatch only gives us the first 30% of lyrics
* The Musixmatch api open-soure plan allows 2000 Api Calls per day and 500 Lyrics displays per day. After we've reached these limits we'll receive a 401 Error, and must sign-up for a new api key
* For our lyrical graphs, we filtered for common non-descriptive words (such as 'THE', 'AND', 'THIS', 'A', 'THAT', 'OF', 'BUT', 'IS', 'FOR', 'TO', 'WAS', 'IT', 'ON', 'IT'S', 'IN', 'MY', 'WITH', 'THAT'S', 'I'M', 'ARE', 'AT', 'IF')





## Deployment

Ready to go world wide? Here's a guide to deployment! There are two
supported ways to deploy in Boilermaker:

* automatically, via continuous deployment with Travis.
* "manually", from your local machine via the `deploy` script.

Either way, you'll need to set up your deployment server to start.
The steps below are also covered in the CI/CD workshop.

### Heroku

1.  Set up the [Heroku command line tools][heroku-cli]
2.  `heroku login`
3.  Add a git remote for heroku:

[heroku-cli]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

* **If you are creating a new app...**

  1.  `heroku create` or `heroku create your-app-name` if you have a
      name in mind.
  2.  `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev` to add
      ("provision") a postgres database to your heroku dyno

* **If you already have a Heroku app...**

  1.  `heroku git:remote your-app-name` You'll need to be a
      collaborator on the app.

### Travis

_**NOTE**_ that this step assumes that Travis-CI is already testing your code.
Continuous Integration is not about testing per se â€“ it's about _continuously
integrating_ your changes into the live application, instead of periodically
_releasing_ new versions. CI tools can not only test your code, but then
automatically deploy your app. This is known as Continuous Deployment.
Boilermaker comes with a `.travis.yml` configuration almost ready for
continuous deployment; follow these steps to the job.

1.  Run the following commands to create a new branch:

```
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b f/travis-deploy
```

2.  Run the following script to finish configuring `travis.yml` :
    `npm run heroku-token`
    This will use your `heroku` CLI (that you configured previously, if
    not then see [above](#Heroku)) to generate an authentication token. It
    will then use `openssl` to encrypt this token using a public key that
    Travis has generated for you. It will then update your `.travis.yml`
    file with the encrypted value to be sent with the `secure` key under
    the `api_key`.
3.  Run the following commands to commit these changes

```
git add .travis.yml
git commit -m 'travis: activate deployment'
git push -u origin f/travis-deploy
```

4.  Make a Pull Request for the new branch, get it approved, and merge it into
    the master branch.

_**NOTE**_ that this script depends on your local `origin` Git remote matching
your GitHub URL, and your local `heroku` remote matching the name of your
Heroku app. This is only an issue if you rename your GitHub organization,
repository name or Heroku app name. You can update these values using
`git remote` and its related commands.

#### Travis CLI

There is a procedure to complete the above steps by installing the official
[Travis CLI tools][travis-cli]. This requires a recent Ruby, but this step
should not be, strictly speaking, necessary. Only explore this option when the
above has failed.

[travis-cli]: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#installation

That's it! From now on, whenever `master` is updated on GitHub, Travis
will automatically push the app to Heroku for you.
